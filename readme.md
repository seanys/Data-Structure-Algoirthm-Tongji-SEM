## Notes and Code for Data Structures and Algorithms（C++）

Author: Yang Shan, Department of Management Science and Engineering, Tongji University

Environment：Apple clang version 11.0.3 (clang-1103.0.32.59), Xcode 11.4.1

This repository contains code and my notes data structures and algorithms taught in Prof. Liang Zhe's class. Algorithms in file  [Final Exam Preparation&Algorithm](Final Exam Preparation&Algorithm) are achieved by myself, some of the other algorithms are adapted from nice code provided by others online and some are programmed by myself.

My notes for these algorithms will be added to this file shortly.



## Basic Knowledge

### Divide and Conquer

The best example for divide and conquer is [merge sort](#merge-sort) which divides a large sorting problem into some small compare problems. This algorithm is robust and quick.

### Time complexity

For example, quick sort's average time complexity is Θ(nlgn) and the worest case O(n^2).
